## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5
- SCSS with BEMIT
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- JS Vanilla

### What I learned

- I reinforced the concepts of flexbox.
- I learned how to place svgs in the pseudo-class "::after".

### Continued development

- The BEMIT convention is very useful because it allows us to write maintainable styles.
- Stop using the absolute measure px and instead use rem and em.

### Useful resources
